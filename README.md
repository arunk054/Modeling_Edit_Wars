# Modeling Edit Wars
An agent-based model and simulation of edit wars in Java.

-------------- Compile the code -----
Compling and running the code is simple - change to the src directory and execute  "javac *.java" without the quotes. Make sure javac is in your PATH.

------- Running the code ------

Following are the entry point files for three experiments in the paper:
Experiment 1: LaunchPCommit.java
Experiment 2: LaunchAlpha.java
Experiment 3: LaunchProfiles.java

The experiment variables can also be configured in the same files.

To run an experiment just change to the src directory, compile and execute "java <Filename without .java suffix>".
